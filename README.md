# CTF Writeup: Pack and Ship

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge, I was given a binary file named `release`. The task was to extract an obfuscated password and flag using reverse engineering techniques.

---


## ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Initial Analysis

First, I used the `strings` command to see if there was any readable text inside the binary.

```
strings release | less
```

**Findings:**

* The binary appeared to be packed with UPX.
---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Unpacking the Binary

Since the binary was UPX-packed, I unpacked it.

```
upx -d release
```

Then, I ran the `strings` command again.

```
strings release | less
```

This time, I saw more useful information, including references to `obfuscated_password`, `obfuscated_flag`, and a function called `deobfuscate`.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Disassembling the Binary

Next, I opened the binary in GDB for further analysis.

```
gdb release
```

I disassembled the `main` function to understand its logic.

```
disassemble main
```

```assembly

    0x0000000000001315 <+145>:   mov     %rax,%rdi
```

**Findings in `main`:**

* The `main` function called `deobfuscate()` twice:
    * Once for `obfuscated_password`.
    * Once for `obfuscated_flag`.
* The obfuscated password was stored at memory location `0x2040`.
* The password after deobfuscation was stored at memory location `0xa0`.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Setting a Breakpoint in `deobfuscate()`

To find the password, I had to inspect the variable where it was stored after the `deobfuscate` function executed.

I set a breakpoint at the `deobfuscate` function.

```
b deobfuscate
```

Then, I ran the program.

```
run
```

When it stopped at the breakpoint, I executed the function completely to return to the main function.

```
finish
```

Now `0xa0` address had the value of the deobfuscated password.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Extracting the Deobfuscated Password

I inspected the memory address of `obfuscated_password` to see the deobfuscated password.

```
x/s $rbp-0xa0
```

The output was: `bt8uA1uxF350yZLuto9GmqTWJBpP2jUq`

This is the correct password

---

## ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Testing the Password and Retrieving the Flag

I ran the program directly and entered the extracted password.
```
./release
Enter the password: bt8uA1uxF350yZLuto9GmqTWJBpP2jUq
Correct password! Here is the flag: gdsc{unp4ck1n6_b1n4r135_15_n4u6h7y}
```

---

# Result:

I obtained the flag `gdsc{unp4ck1n6_b1n4r135_15_n4u6h7y}`.
