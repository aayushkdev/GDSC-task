# CTF Writeup: Hidden Pixels

## Challenge Overview

I was trying to analyse and extract hidden data from `output.bmp` using various steganography and forensic techniques. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step log of everything I tried.

---

## 1. Checking Metadata

First, I used `exiftool` to extract metadata from the image:

```
exiftool output.bmp
```

**Findings:**

* Found that the image is a Windows V5 BMP with 32-bit depth.
* Detected sRGB color space and an alpha channel.

---

## 2. Checking for Steganography with steghide

I ran `steghide` to check if any data is hidden:

```
steghide info output.bmp
```

**Result:**

* Got an error: the bmp file has a format that is not supported (biSize: 124).
* Since `steghide` does not support BMP V5, I had to convert it to an older format.

---

## 3. Converting BMP Version

Tried converting the BMP file using `ffmpeg`:

```
ffmpeg -i output.bmp -pix_fmt rgb24 output_v3.bmp
```

**Result:**

* This converted successfully to a Windows 3.x format, 24-bit depth BMP.

---

## 4. Checking steghide Again

Tried `steghide` on `output_v3.bmp`:

```
steghide info output_v3.bmp
```

**Result:**

* This time, it asked for a password, meaning there might be hidden data inside.

---

## 5. Using zsteg for LSB Steganography

I ran `zsteg` to check for hidden Least Significant Bit (LSB) data:

```
zsteg output_v3.bmp
```

**Findings:**

* Found some hidden text:
    * `b4,r,lsb,xy -> "DC4&vjhf"`
    * `b4,g,lsb,xy -> "3WDeQTC13>F"`
    * `b3,g,lsb,xy -> "u(/dFdLG"`
    * `b3,rgb,lsb,xy -> "oX =@\rp%"`
    * `b3,r,msb,xy -> OpenPGP Public Key`
* The OpenPGP key might be interesting, but I already tried extracting and analyzing it, and it did not give any results.

---

## 6. Bruteforcing steghide

Since `steghide` needed a password, I tried brute-forcing:

```
stegcracker output_v3.bmp wordlist.txt
```

**Result:**

* Bruteforcing didn't work, so the password remains unknown.
